# Arm11-Asteroids
Project built as an extension in the spring of 2019 in my first year of university for the ARM-11 emulator project at Imperial College London in collaboration with Judicael Clair, Abel Shields, and Nat Karmios. It is a fully-functioning game of asteroids designed to run on the raspberry pi, with rendering at 100 FPS. Video link below of a demonstration to the game!
